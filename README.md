## Tips for use

1. About Demixer
   - Facebook Research's Demucs models (htdemucs, htdemucs_6s, htdemucs_ft, mdx_extra) all show good performance.
   - Demucs runs quite well even on low-end PCs (8GB of RAM).
   - In MDX-Net, UVR-MDX-NET-Voc_FT, Kim_Vocal_2, UVR_MDXNET_KARA_2, etc. show good performance.
   - MDX-Net models only operate on high-end PCs (RAM 16GB or more).
   - Try using the models one by one and find one that suits your purpose.
   - We recommend using the latest NVIDIA GPU (VRAM 6GB or higher). Out-of-memory errors may occur if VRAM is insufficient.

2. About Whisper
   - Large-V2 model is best. The rest have poor recognition rates.
   - If the audio language is 'Korean', it is best to set the Whisper language to 'Korean' as well.
   - When the audio language is 'Korean', if you set the Whisper language to 'Japanese', 'Japanese' will be output, but the accuracy will be low. (Google Translator is better.)
   - The **Denoise** option removes noise using the MDX-Net model. Voice recognition results may improve. (Use only on high-end PC)

## Caution!!
When Windows Defender mistakenly recognizes a batch file as a Trojan, this is often called a 'False Positive'. To solve this problem, you can go through the following steps:

1. File exception handling: In Windows Defender, you can set certain files or processes to skip security scanning. To do this, follow the steps below:
   * Click the ‚ÄòStart‚Äô button and go to ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô.
   * Click ‚ÄòUpdate & Security‚Äô.
   * Select ‚ÄòWindows Security‚Äô and go to ‚ÄòVirus & threat protection‚Äô.
   * Click ‚ÄòManage Virus & Threat Protection Settings‚Äô.
   * Select 'Add exception' in 'Virus & threat protection settings'.
   * Select 'File or Folder', find the batch file in question and add it as an exception.
2. Temporarily disable Windows Defender: This may be a temporary solution. However, you must be careful when using this method as it may expose your computer to other threats.
3. Report the problem to anti-virus software: If you are sure that the file is not a Trojan horse, you can report it to Microsoft as a False Positive. Microsoft will review this and take any necessary action.
